# nkts

The "experimental" multi-platform script execution engine for a certain vn game. Just for fun.

This is "experimental" i.e. quite far from the best.

## Prerequisites

* Computer with OpenGL capability
    * (now using PistonDevelopers/piston for prototyping, will move to Vulkan/winit based frontend)
* Latest Rust stable compiler
* All assets extracted under `./blob/`
    * images should be in `.S25` format so that the metadata is intact.
        * Use `arc-unpacker` or `GARbro`. I'm lazy.
* A lot of patience
    * Seriously...

## Current status

* Script
    * Commands
        ```
        TODO: 
        ```
* Scene
    * [ ] TBD
